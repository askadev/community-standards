# Ask a Dev Mentor Guidelines

## Expectations

Expect to be patient. Expect to hear terminology used incorrectly. Expect to still have autonomy - you reserve the right to not work with someone or on a project. Expect to explain complex problems in simple terms (rule of thumb for teaching a programming language or framework: if you can explain it to your parents, you can explain it to anyone). Expect to support a business (e.g. cafe) if you’re using their space.

Do not expect to work after the session. While we want to build relationships, we don't want to fuel burn out. Do what you can, when you can. Do not expect to be able to solve every problem.

## Liability

Ask a Dev is not responsible for any changes to code you touch or for any advice you provide and what comes of it. All services are provided as is, by you, not Ask a Dev, and those services come without warranty of any kind. We encourage you to announce a disclaimer before working on production code. Be careful. Be clear. Protect yourself.

## Format

Follow an "office hours" approach: high-accessibility, low-pressure, dedicated window. There's no script to follow, no announcements to be made, no RSVPs to confirm. Simply be available for when you say you will be.

## Promotion

This collective aims to start local communities. We encourage reaching out to places that aren't dev-centric (e.g. a message board for videographers) or places that are in orbit (e.g. a project manager Slack group). Some cities have [event calendars](https://calagator.org/) to post to. When using a third-party service (e.g. Eventbrite), use succinct copy and include the website in full (https://askadev.org). We utilize an [organization Meetup account](https://www.meetup.com/Ask-A-Dev/) for cross-promotion.

In-person is a great way to promote; not every dev at a talk or hosted meetup is an expert, and they wouldn't be there if they weren't trying to learn already.

Stickers and business cards will be sent to chapter founders and more can be sent on request. As a collective, we'll offer as much help as we can, but we can't guarantee promoting an event besides listing it on the site. We’ll connect you with other mentors in the same city to coordinate ideal spots.

Brand assets (including logo, sample poster, and business card template) and standards are available in [a public Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/VQtbS1atoQp5ooQBi6iwl6gC/Ask-a-Dev-Brand-and-Assets).

## Space

We prefer public, accessible places with reliable WiFi. Cafes and university libraries are perfect. Feel free to check ahead and ensure there's space before setting up an event. If it’s a business, please patronize them and encourage your participants to patronize. Always, always respect others around you.

While meetings can occur in a loaned space - like an agency's common area - we aim to avoid the pressure of coming to a dedicated building. Public spaces are relaxed, allow serendipitous walk ups, and have no ulterior agenda.

When you're hosting a session, ensure the Ask a Dev logo is prominently displayed (e.g. business card, sticker, or tablet). Like a lighthouse.

## Frequency

Having a regular schedule (e.g. first Wednesday of month from 5 to 8) in a consistent location is ideal, but we understand it's not always achievable. We aim for at least one event per month.

## FAQ

### What if I'm the only dev and there's a queue?

Max your time per person to 15 minutes if there’s backup. If you hit that threshold, set the person you're helping onto a task. This parallelism will allow participant one to remain engaged while giving participant two attention.

### Sample copy for a description?

> Whether you're a new programmer, a veteran exploring a new language, or a tech-adverse soul lost in a sea of WYSIWYG site generators, we're here to help. Join us for a few hours every other week as we answer your frustrations.

### How do you ensure quality?

Ideally, two or more mentors are present at every event to keep each other in check. We also provide a means for participants to [contact us](https://askadev.org#feedback) to report bad behavior/low quality advice.
